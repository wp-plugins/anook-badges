Add an anook badge to your website and share your profile live, with ease.

== Description ==
This plugin allows you to add a shortcode or widget to your blog that quickly, and easily shows your up to date anook stats. This plugin is very easy to use as long as you have your username or your nook / game id. You can just specify which it is, so in the widget you click the dropdown and say "I want my user profile to show". Then paste in your username in the text box and boom! It's right there. :)

Anook is a gamers social platform: http://anook.com

I would just like to note that all images used in this plugin are rightfully directly from anook.com for continuity in the house style. I have no made any of them, just used them.

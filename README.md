# Wp-anook-badge
This is a wordpress plugin for adding a small anook badge onto your website.

<h3>Examples</h3>
```
[anook user="SurDaft"]
```
This can be used to show just my profile
```
[anook user="SurDaft" user="Chocy" nook="3855" game="3"]
```
Or you can string many badge shortcodes into 1 and they will just output one after another

My intention is that as the API grows so does this plugin.
